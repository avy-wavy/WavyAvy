### 🌊 WavyAvy — My Personal Discord Bot
Hey! This is WavyAvy, a little Discord bot I'm building mostly for myself. I wanted a clean way to manage notes inside Discord, without having to switch apps or use sticky notes everywhere. It's still pretty simple right now, but it works!
I'm just learning and experimenting as I go, so things might break or change — but that's part of the fun.

## What It Can Do (for now)

/addnote [note] → adds a note
/notes → shows your list of notes

✅ You can mark notes as done with a dropdown
🗑️ You can delete notes from the same view

Only you can see and edit your own notes (private + per-user)
Right now everything is stored in memory, so notes disappear when the bot restarts. I'll add proper saving soon.

## Why I’m Making This
I just wanted a space where I could quickly jot stuff down while I’m chatting or studying. I also wanted to learn how Discord bots work — slash commands, buttons, dropdowns, cogs — all that cool stuff.
This is part learning project, part productivity tool.

## Built With
-Python
-discord.py (v2+)
-Slash commands (app_commands)
-UI stuff like views and dropdowns

## Coming Soon / Ideas
Persistent storage (SQLite or JSON maybe)
Deadlines + reminders
Journaling feature (like daily entries)
Task filtering (done/undone)
Hosting it somewhere (probably on Replit or Railway)

## Dev Log & Updates
I’m trying to update this repo daily (or close to it).
This project helps me stay consistent, learn Python better, and (hopefully) build something useful.

Thanks for checking it out 🙂
